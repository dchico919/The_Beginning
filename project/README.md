#### Description: In this project, I certainly added the required HTML, SQL, and Flask coding. I chose to code my project in Python, which provided a solid foundation for development. One day, an interesting task came my way: creating an Excel spreadsheet that could calculate various financial aspects such as income, expenses, and more. This coding endeavor proved to be both exhilarating and exhausting, pushing my problem-solving skills to the limit. As I had limited people to discuss my frustrations with the code, I decided to take a cue from the classes I attended and acquired my own set of "duckies" to talk to. These little companions, affectionately named Rick and Morty, became a source of solace during challenging coding sessions. Talking to them felt like expressing my thoughts to a wall, but their silent presence was oddly comforting. Going back to the project, I decided to create a website that could cater to the specific needs of the business in question. Users visiting the website could receive a unique code, regardless of whether they were a guest or a registered user. However, guest users were limited to one quote per email address. To facilitate this functionality, I implemented a database labeled database1.db to store the input provided by guest users. Upon entering their email address, the information would be saved in the appropriate folder and then utilized on the subsequent pages. At this stage, the code is uploaded merely as a completed assignment. However, I have aspirations to continue refining and expanding it to the point where it can be deployed on a live server, offering practical value and real-world application. Ultimately, this course has proven to be immensely worthwhile. It has provided me with an opportunity to pursue my passion for programming, offering a promising future that diverges from the physically strenuous work I used to do as a mechanic. The incessant demands and lack of consideration for my well-being in previous jobs have left me eager to embrace a career where I can work on my computer, engage my interests, and continuously learn new things. I am grateful for the chance to delve into a subject that has captivated my interest for a considerable time. This project, with its challenges and rewards, has fueled my enthusiasm to keep expanding my knowledge and skills. I am excited to see what the future holds and how I can further improve both personally and professionally in the world of coding and web development.
